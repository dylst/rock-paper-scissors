# rock-paper-scissors

Simple implementation of a rock, paper, scissors style game utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS.

This is my first HTML/CSS/JS project that helped me learn how each language interacts with one another.

The first stage | Game in the browser console
This stage involved implementing basic functionality with JavaScript.

The second stage | Game with added UI
This stage involved adding a UI to make the game playable on a UI rather than simply in the console.
